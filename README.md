# PL-SQL-Loops
Basic PL/SQL loop assignment from Oracle and SQL course

Problem #1: Write the program to display the math facts 1 + 1 = 2, 2 + 2 = 4, 3 + 3 = 6, 4 + 4 = 8 using a basic LOOP structure.

Problem #2: Redo problem #1 using a FOR loop.

Problem #3: Redo problem #1 using a WHILE loop.

Problem #4: Now do a nested loop where each of the numbers you are adding is a separate variable controlled by its own loop. Do this using a WHILE structure. Note I am looking for something that starts with 1 + 1 = 2, 1 + 2 = 3, 1 + 3 = 4, 1 + 4 = 5 and then 2 + 1 = 2 etc with the final one being 4 + 4 = 8.

Problem #5: Redo #4 using a basic loop structure.

Problem #6: Redo #4 using a FOR loop.

Problem #7: You want to determine how many of a particular item can be purchased given the amount you have to spend. Clearly you need to establish the item price and how much you have to spend. The result on the screen should tell how many of that item you can purchase.
